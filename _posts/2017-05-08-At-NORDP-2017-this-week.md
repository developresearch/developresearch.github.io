This week I will be attending the National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP) 2017 conference in Broomfield, CO. On Tuesday, I will present a poster on assessment of the three pillars that support research development & administration success: service quality, organizational culture, and process efficiency.

I'm looking forward to meeting other research development professionals and receiving their input!
