This week I will be attending the National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP) 2017 conference in Broomfield, CO. On Tuesday, I will be presenting a poster on assessing the three pillars that support research development & administration success.

Looking forward to meeting other research development professionals and receiving their input!
