Holistic assessment of the performance level at an Office of Sponsored Programs presents a complex challenge that requires the consideration of multiple performance indicators. Among these are:
- Research activity
- Service quality
- Organizational culture
- Process metrics
Acquiring data about each of these factors requires the use of multiple sources of information. We can draw from institutional electronic research administration systems (eRA), service quality and culture questionnaires, and electronic request tracking systems.
